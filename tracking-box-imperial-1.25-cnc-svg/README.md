These are transliterated SVG files from the Imperial STL's (sorry, no metric version for now). Since they were originally 3 dimensional and we've converted to 2D, some things are lost in translation. As such, there are additional finishing steps needed before they are usable. Please use the STL files as models for what needs to be done to finish the parts out. I have more info here:
