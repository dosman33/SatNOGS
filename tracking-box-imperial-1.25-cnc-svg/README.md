These are transliterated SVG files from the Imperial STL's (sorry, no metric version for now). I would consider these files good for CNC routing. If you are looking for laserable files (and have a hobby grade laser cutter/etcher), please see the “*-laser-svg” sub-project for 3-layer versions of these parts (safer and cleaner to cut).

Since these parts were originally 3 dimensional and I’ve converted them to 2D, some things are lost in translation. As such, there are additional finishing steps needed before they are usable. Please use the STL files as models for what needs to be done to finish the parts out. I have more info here:
