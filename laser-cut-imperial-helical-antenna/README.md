This is a laser-cuttable SVG for making an Imperial-PVC based UHF helical antenna (polarized). Here is the original part source (metric):

I found that the existing 2D design (svg) was not scaled correctly even for metric so I rescaled it and as well as resized the PVC holes for imperial diemensions.


This is the triangle spacer that holds the PVC together. The design calls for 4 of these parts to be cut:

I made two versions of the antenna base. This one has the complete base in one piece (only cut 1 of these if you have a larger size laser):

The “-imperial-A” and “-imperial-B” files are two halves of the same part. This is so that folks with smaller laser cutters (like I have access to) can still laser cut the base even though it’s larger than the 12”x20” laser bed. Then just attach the two pieces together (cut one of each):

Lastly, you may notice I have the word “TOP” engraved on all of the parts. Just in case there were imperfections in my hole alignment, I did this so that the PVC pipe will still align correctly through each trangle piece if you line up the words. You shouldn’t have to do that, but this was a catch-all just in case I messed up.
